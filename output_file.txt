 Hi everybody, welcome back to philosophy 2073 death. Um, I said it in such an excited way. Uh, this is the first video lecture that I'll be producing for week five. I'm going to produce two, one for each of the two separate readings that are Epicurus, one's three pages long, one's four pages long, so I don't expect these video lectures to be terribly lengthy. Um, the first thing that I want to, uh, do, however, is a very quick review and then to talk about what it means that there's been a shift in the course. So, um, this is the first video lecture for unit two. Uh, why is death bad? Or is it just called is death bad is death bad? Um, I'm going to talk about that in a second. Let me first do my brief review. What have we been talking about to this point in the course definitions of death? So, remember, philosophy is about making arguments, presenting the best available reasons, because we're finite and fallible, assembling them to ensure that your beliefs are justified and then presenting them publicly. So as to mitigate your finitude and fallibility, that is your individual uselessness. And in order to be able to have a meaningful exchange to in order to be able to, um, ensure that our beliefs are indeed justified, we're going to need to present some, we're going to need to ensure that what it is we're discussing is clearly defined. And so over the course of weeks one through four, we've been engaging with arguments that seek to explain how we do or ought to understand death either as a state of being or not, or as a moment in time that can be pinpointed or as as we saw in selben last week, a, a, a, a concept that can be unpacked owing to its prevalence and regular use in human communication. No small irony that Felden's conclusion was ultimately we can't completely unpack that notion in other words, as a concept, death is more mysterious than you would expect it to be given the, um, given its prevalence and its frequent use within human communication. But for our purposes we're moving on so that what does that mean technically, I mean, we could get stuck in talking about what is death for the duration of the course, but we're moving on to something new. And the something new actually starts with something old so first thing we're going to talk about is epicurus first reading we're talking about notice the dates epicurus 341 to 270 BCE so epicurus was born like six years after Plato died and Aristotle was 40 to lived another 20 years when epicurus after epicurus was born died when epicurus was about 20 he's a contemporary of Plato and Aristotle then in that sense. He is not as widely read and so that's why I don't have like I did with Plato a special video dedicated just to introducing epicurus. He is not as significant a figure as Plato and Aristotle, but that's kind of through no fault of his own we lost his work so we have five fragments three letters and two sets of fragments of what are maybe students notes of what epicurus wrote we actually know him his view best through subpoena. Through subsequent scholars Roman scholars, particularly a guy named Dioge and ease laerties and Lucretius who the reading after epicurus is a Lucretius reading we're not talking about that, but if you wanted to read Lucretius would give you a little more insight into at least what he takes epicurus to be on about he is Lucretius is an epicurian. i'm going to get to in just a second one of one of the things that epicurus is most well known for is his. belief claim that. The common intuition that death is bad for the person who has died. Is flawed so as you'll see as you can see in the title here according to epicurus death is nothing. We death death is a problem only because we worry about it so notice epicurus recognizes that everybody thinks that death is bad but epicurus argues that everybody is wrong to think that death is bad and in particular in the letter to many occupants so the first reading that we're going to. I'm going to talk about in this video that is where epicurus makes that argument most explicitly. Before we start to engage the details however I just want to reiterate because i've kind of already said it but make clear exactly how. Things change from unit one to unit two so. Up to this point. We have been focused on merely trying to understand death as a moment or a state or a concept. In this segment of the course. We're asking a normative or taking it for granted that we know what death is roughly. And so maybe Feldman was right good enough for us because Feldman did can see that you know most of us most of the time outside the weird parameters of. Suspended animation and or vision and or fusion. Death is a is the cessation of life so. For a human for the person that is going to die is death bad. Our shared intuition I take it is yes in other words is death bad not for the people around you but for you you the person who is going to for me the person who is going to die is death bad now that is a. Value question that is a normative question why. Because that question necessarily invokes a concern about a question of what is valuable in human life what what counts as good and what counts as bad in the context of human existence. And it's only once we've got some kind of answer to that question that we will be able to articulate the sense in which we are justified in thinking that death is bad or we should be more like a. Curious and think that death is not bad or maybe Plato who arguably thought that death was good but you shouldn't seek it out. Okay so just in an effort for me to sort of clarify what we're on about for the next four weeks so for week five and then week six is the midterm but then week seven eight and nine. Yes I think so we're investigating the shared common shared intuition that death is a bad thing and we're effectively looking at arguments that try to explain why we're justified in having that intuition or not. This epicurus reading is the or not so this the the modern debate that we're going to be talking about starting in week seven starting with the nagle reading that debate is stimulated in large part by epicurus and his claim that we know we shouldn't be afraid of death we're just being ridiculous by being afraid of death. Like I said on the previous slide this kind of discussion presupposes some prior understanding of what does good and bad refer to in the context of a human life and under that heading. Philosophers have constructed a label of reference to a theory of value a theory of value is just what it sounds like and what I'm trying to describe in this bullet it's an account of those things that are good and or bad in the context of human life and notice I have tried to unpack it in a little more detail so what does a. Theory of value try to do it tries to identify describe explain justify our beliefs about those elements of human life that are valuable so notice as a theory that's what it means for it to be a theory and that's why I have the bracketed comparison to the theory of evolution what is the theory of evolution seek to do it seeks to explain and describe and justify our. Beliefs about changing organisms over time changing by a lot changes in biological organisms over time on the planet earth. That's that's what the theory of evolution seeks to do explain describe justify those changes our beliefs about those changes predict future changes. A theory of value tries to do the same thing so i'm drawing the comparison and maybe it's not hitting home I hope it is there's no way for me to judge because I can't tell how you're reacting to what i'm saying right now but I know a significant proportion of you in this course right now are science students met medical science students so look just think by reference to the theory of evolution when you see theory of value it's not a mystery. It's trying to do that it's a theory just like the theory of evolution what is the theory of evolution try to do it tries to describe and explain and justify our beliefs about changes in biological organisms over time on the planet earth. What does the theory of value do same thing it seeks to explain and describe and identify and justify our beliefs about values. What counts as good and what counts as bad in human life now we are reading epicurus based on his primarily owing to his claim and brief argument in the letter to many acus. That death is not bad for the person that has died because he as we'll see him say. Death is nothing that's not actually the primary goal of this reading the primary goal of this either of these readings the primary goal of these two readings is for epicurus to articulate his theory of value what he's trying to articulate is what makes a good life now much like when I was talking about Plato and Plato's theory. So in Plato's theory of forms epicurus doesn't talk about a theory of value he doesn't he doesn't say I'm defending a theory of value he doesn't that label doesn't exist when epicurus is writing nonetheless since epicurus was rediscovered in roughly I mean he was always around but considerably more attention started to be paid to him in the late 18th and early 19th century in England. Epicurus is widely regarded as the sort of not sort of the founder of hedonism so hedonism is the view that what matters in life is pleasure there is only in fact hedonism is more rigid there is only. Only one thing that is valuable in human life the one thing that is valuable in human life is pleasure the one thing that is bad in human life is pain and any. Any other type of pleasure is subordinate to well any action that a human performs is ultimately seeking to realize pleasure over pain. Okay last preliminary thing before we start to engage with the text about epicurus he is radically anti play though so epicurus is a empiricist he believes in other words that we can only make knowledge claims based on sensory experience. And if you recall and he was explicitly anti playtinist so Plato's view was dominant at the time that epicurus was writing an epicurus thought the theory of forms was a load of who he nonsense. And so Plato thought that you could know stuff just by reasoning based on your basic knowledge of the forms without having to rely directly on sensory experience. Epicurus thought sensory experience is the only possible source of knowledge. That's important for understanding epicurus's view on death and why he says that death is nothing to us. Of course all of this is going to come up in the reading so let's get into the first three pages for three and a bit pages. The letter to many office what does it appear epicurus is ultimately trying to argue that the only thing you should be concerned with in life is the pursuit of happiness and what we really need to focus on is what he means exactly by the pursuit of happiness and notice I've given you a hint. He's going to argue that it's the kind of happiness that is appropriate to rational and mortal humans so people who die. Why do why does anyone ever act in any particular way according to epicurus it is because they are seeking happiness. And so what is he actually doing in these three and a bit pages he's actually trying to give a recipe okay here's how you achieve happiness and you just have to think through it the right way the way I'm thinking through it says he'll show you he'll show you apparently says epicurus. This is this last bit of the thesis here so he doesn't actually give us the heads up on what happiness actually involves but i'll give you i'll i'll give you a spoiler it's about living a pleasant life. So one of the great ways in which historically epicurus has been grossly misinterpreted is his hedonism is frequently taken to mean something like you should only ever act on the basis of extreme pleasure and so you should only ever be concerned with like base animal pleasures eating and sex and. Just fun stuff whatever whatever base instinct you might have that's what you should pursue that's the historical misinterpretation that that is not epicurus is view at all epicurus is view is you should you should live a pleasant life you should actually not seek pleasures that are likely to be. Likely to. Cause you anxiety so. I don't look we're going to get into this but basically the idea is for epicurus happiness means no pain and if some forms of pleasure increase the potential for pain those forms of pleasure should be avoided. And what does that mean material pleasures greed wanting things that you don't have what is that going to do that's going to produce anxiety. And so what should you do you should content yourself with. The basics that you need in order to get by. In order to not experience pain from hunger and lack of shelter and stuff like that but you should not shoot for the stars epicurus is surprising down around this doesn't think you should you shouldn't be going after things that might disappoint you you shouldn't dream. It's a very not modern way of looking at the world but epicurus thinks you should just look eat your barley cakes will get to that eat your barley cakes and just be happy with barley cakes are fine. I don't know I picture barley cakes to be very similar to rice cakes which are. Styrofoam in a food form anyway. Like rice cakes put peanut butter on I guess they're fine but not great. So burdens pursuing happiness doesn't actually mean radically pursuing pleasures according to. Epicurus pursuing happiness means avoiding pain. And so he makes this point after his first step about believing in the God so one thing you got to do is to be again to enjoy a pleasant life you have to. To finish your anxiety about the character of human role within the universe and remember this is ancient Greek so ancient Greece so ancient Greek mythology is still. The dominant sort of religious view were less than a hundred years removed for from the point of which Socrates was put to death owing to his corrupting the youth by ministering to them about false gods. So epicurus says look you got to recognize that gods exist because everybody talks about gods. We have clear knowledge of them so I know I just that just a minute ago epicurus is an empiricist and that means he depends on sensory data as a means of drawing conclusions I take it the sensory data he's relying on here are the reports of others. So we all know there are gods because we all talk about the gods as though there are gods but not everyone's talking about the gods actually captures the truth about the gods in fact a lot of statements about the gods make these weird claims make gods seem too human. And so says epicurus got to watch carefully what you want to look for are those things people are saying about the gods that refers to their blessedness don't really know what he means by that but they're. Perfection their inherent goodness something like that and their indestructibility any other statement so all the Greek method so epicurus is. This. Graduating a very fine line in as much as socrates was put death a mere 60 years earlier roughly for having questioned the commonly accepted Athenian account of the gods. So apricarest just comes out and says it look there are two characteristics that gods have to have this is what we have clear knowledge of but most people are going to say stuff that makes it sound like the gods fight and the gods die and the gods the gods do all sorts of horrible things that aren't blessed at all. When people say stuff like that so for the record most of Greek mythology one would assume when people characterize the gods in this way they are not accurately characterizing them indeed I am being a little imprecise in my bullet points here. Apricarest tries to talk about God singular like a god believe in so that's why my heading for this section he really does seem to have accepted latched on to a basic early Judeo not yet Christian but Judeo conception of a monotheistic. So the universe rather than the pluralistic plural theistic universe of the of ancient Greek mythology one god instead of multiple gods says apricarest now if you if you actually accept these false beliefs then that will trouble you because it will make it seem as though the gods. Are just as. Valable and messed up as us humans. That will be a great source of harm notice the appeal in p4 that apricarest is trying to make here he's making he's also making an appeal to just truth false beliefs are bad true beliefs are good. How can false beliefs be bad well in part for him they're going to create an anxiety about the character of humans rule within the universe and just the character of the universe generally there are no indestructible and blessed creatures in it if there is no god. Those who do see the truth truth is good so they will enjoy benefits as a result of seeing the truth what is all of this mean and again this is notice what I'm referring to in these bullet points is the specific numbered paragraphs oh which are numbered within the text so they're not actually I think their page numbers from the original. Compilation of this small excerpt that we have left over preserved from apricarest. So this is similar to the standard Aristotle or Plato pagination that we saw when we were talking about fado. Um. So step one or living a pleasant life on apricarest's count is leaving God but only those things that you hear other say about God that preserve God's blessedness and indestructibility. Anything else you should shut out of your mind. Okay. This next part paragraphs 124 to 127 this explains why this portion this reading is included in our anthology this is the portion of the reading that um. Nagle and Williams and the authors that we're going to be talking about are primarily referring to when they refer back to apricarest. So. P1 at 124. What I'm calling P1 by the way I should have reminded you I know I don't do this for the modern readings but for the ancient readings I'm trying to break them down into the distinct premises. You should be looking searching through the reading as I'm doing this in the video lecture trying to locate the sentence that leads me to that it's a sense he says it right so this is this ends right toward the beginning of paragraph 124 is apricarest's statement of his empiricism knowledge of good and bad comes from sense experience and sense experience only. You can't sit around and stroke your tin and know anything about what qualifies as good and bad in human life. Instead you have to actually reflect on and and and accumulate a set of experiences that will direct you toward what is good and bad in human life. Yes is the absence of sense experience so notice apricarest here is very in line with Edwards very in line with. Point man and and and and Feldman right what is death it's a cessation of life or what's one of the characteristic features of life sense experience and according to. So it's a very dangerous it is the only. Basis upon which you can gather knowledge of what's good and bad in human life so. Says apricarest death actually let me I'm not I'm not done with that death is the end of all sense experience good and bad is. Only knowable by needs of sense experience so there's no sense in which death can be either go to bed it is nothing. Because it's the end of sense experience now says apricarest I so I jumped ahead a little bit but on the way so death is the end of all experience sense experience and then apricarest takes note of the fact that or what he thinks death should do. Are awareness of the fact that we are going to die should actually be a source of contentment there will be an end point to this existence. If we never thought it was going to be coming to an end our lives then we would be experiencing anxiety says apricarest about the nature and possibility of the future that we might live. Anxiety at the possibility of being able to experience absolutely everything there is to experience because time will never be an issue what's good about death it provides us with a finite set of options there's only so much life you can enjoy. So prioritize those things that are most meaningful that generate the greatest amount of pleasure for you. And that limited set of options should make you feel like thank goodness I don't have an infinite set of options to choose from. And says apricarest but this isn't what happens people don't look at death as a source of contentment people are afraid of death and that fear is the source of unnecessary pain we experience pain because we're afraid that eventually our sense experiences will come to an end. But once those sense experiences come to an end there's nothing for us to experience so says apricarest death is not present when we exist because when we exist we're alive when we're alive we're not dead by definition. And once we're dead we don't exist anymore so notice again radically anti play though there's no meeting of the with the forms there's no soul separating from the body none of that it's no more sensory experience no more life no more life no more things to worry about. So death is not a thing an event that we should be afraid of this is not to say like a play dough before him apricarest agrees you know we don't want to hasten death there's no there's no need to resent life or fear life. But there's also no reason to fear death because when you're dead there's no you and when there's no you there's no experience of death because. In a preliminary nod to Edwards death is not a state of being contrary to play dough. So put in simpler terms death is the deprivation the taking away the deprived you've been when you died you are now deprived of sense experience and sense experience is the only source of knowledge about whether something is good or bad. So if you don't have sense experiences death is neither good nor bad the problem is that fear of death creates anxiety and in that sense creates unnecessary pain. And so what we need to the reason we need to recognize that death is not bad for us that death is neither good nor bad is because our intuition are shared the common sense that death is bad for us is causing is the source of this unnecessary anxiety that prevents us from enjoying a pleasant life. So step two step one believe in God how do I get to a pleasant life use philosophy to identify the following steps step one believe in God step two recognize that death is not something to be afraid of and so stop being afraid of death. Don't seek it out says epicurus but don't you're not don't be afraid of it it's not a because you're not you're gone. And so the next step once you've gotten believe in God and and don't worry about death then you proceed to okay now I have to identify will which sense experiences exactly are good and which are bad so here a value right which which sensory experiences should we pursue and which should we avoid. Epicurus in what comes to be an explicit albeit negative definition of pleasure all human action is motivated not by pleasure as a like positive thing all human is action is motivated by avoiding pain or terror. Pleasure is according to epicurus the absence of pain and so what do we need to be most focused on not increasing experiences of happiness but decreasing experiences of pain because when we're not feeling pain says epicurus we are by definition happy. Notice by the way this is probably contrary to your general intuitions about what happiness is it or pleasure is a reference to but for epicurus pleasure is think of it like a continuum and the midpoint I don't know it doesn't have to be the midpoint but the midpoint roughly in the continuum so this side is all pain. This side is all pleasure says epicurus all we got to do is get to that midpoint it's a very low bar. And as it turns out it gets more complicated than that why because there are some pleasures that it looks that they are pleasurable in the moment but those pleasures aren't necessary to ensuring that it's not a good way to get it. To ensuring that the body or the soul will remain free from disturbance in other words they're not necessary to avoid pain and terror. In fact says epicurus some things like extravagant living keeping up with the Joneses though that's not what epicurus has in mind if you don't know what that mean keeping up with your neighbor you know having the stuff your friends have. You know you do I hope you don't feel this way anymore although most of us do to some extent most of the time you know the grass is always greener on the other side what I want what somebody else has because what they have seen super awesome and so I wanted. That feeling is according to epicurus a source of pain why would you put yourself don't don't don't want after things other people have don't seek out extravagant living or or a good reputation among others because that's not necessary for you to survive and it's likely to create anxiety. What does this mean. You should choose only those pleasures like eating barley cakes so this is point up which barley cakes come up ice again I assume barley cakes are gross. And epicurus is making a really minimal look be happy with hardly anything be happy with having what you need and a constant supply of what you need in order to survive so that you don't have to. Feel pain and terror at the possibility of for example starving and once you've made that minimal baseline stop don't seek to improve your lot in life beyond excessively maybe that's the way to put it. Again why because epicurus look I don't know that he's wrong I mean he's he's it's counter intuitive it's not we all strive for greatness or something like that right. But striving for greatness and competing with others and seeking to make yourself to do to do whatever it is you do well. That's always going to be something that opens itself up to comparisons with others and there will be ways in which you believe rightly or wrongly that you are deficient when compared to others and that belief is a source of pain. So says epicurus white bomb don't just when I say says epicurus be happy what I mean is get what you need to maintain a habitable life beyond that. Because if you go beyond that you're going to actually cause yourself more stress than you would have otherwise experienced. Okay so three steps leaving God stop being afraid of death. Figure out that really the kinds of pleasures you should be seeking are those pleasures that satisfy your minimal life requirements and finally choose prudence be aware beat don't jump into things blindfolded. Prudent what is prudent mean. Think about what you're doing when you're doing it and how doing that thing whatever it happens to be could generate negative consequences for you. So you want to be an honorable person and you want to be a just person a fair person someone who lives according to the rules of interacting with other persons. But why do you want to do that. You want to do that because that's what's going to secure a pleasant life. It's look if you don't live prudently you run the risk of angering others. If you run the risk of angering others that means that you are undermining your own security and so your own pleasant living. So prudence is the thing stability is the thing don't rely on chance rely instead on your own capacity to choose to perform those actions that will do you to others but not run the risk of creating unnecessary enemies who might. So what your pleasant life. Last way of putting prudence. Prudence is be cautious just just think it through don't go for too much right these all go together don't worry about death believe in God not the gods that everyone talks about God the blessedness and the indestructibility. And you'll be good. In the next video lecture I'll talk about the last four pages of the epicurus reading as we'll see. Same basic themes so it will be a relatively quick video lecture albeit presented in a kind of different way so you will see me then.
