 Hi everybody and welcome to another week of the course. This week with the topic I refer to it as a disrupted daily living and really covers two chapters of the course. The first one is related to sleep, disordered sleeping and you may not recognize it before coming into the course, but there are a lot of sleeping disorders that also, while there would be respirology, often get referred through there through medicine. There are also often seen through mental health and many of them can also result in mental health diagnoses, as you'll see in the textbook. Some types of insomnia, for example, or parosomnia. I like to use this portion of the course to really push the idea of getting students to recognize the value of sleep. It is often seen as one of these things that you can try to minimize, get through on, try to exist on a minimal amount and just sort of get through the day, apply yourself with caffeine in order to sort of make yourself more alert when you're tired. But the research on sleep is pretty clear that sleep deprivation, such as you would be having at this time of this term, can really have an effect on your cognitive functioning. It has an effect on your mental health. It has an effect on emotional functioning. And that's pretty clear. I mean, there are some disorders where sleep is disrupted, such as we talked about earlier in the term with depression, where depression will disrupt sleep anxiety disorders. We'll disrupt sleep. But sleep will also have an effect on mental health. If you have an tendency towards a mental health disorder, poor sleep will exacerbate that. If you have just things going on that are problematic in your life, poor sleep will exacerbate your negative emotional reactions to those events. That's just a really quite challenging. Now we don't like to think of ourselves as basically very large, small children. But some of the things you see in small children, you also see with adults. So you can always tell when a small child is overtired because they'll be more cranky. They'll be more wippy. They'll get teary about things. They'll get more obstinate. Because they're overtired. The truth is we don't grow out of that. We are somewhat better able to control it as we go older and our front lobes develop. But we still have some of those same innate reactions of emotional, emotions being exacerbated when we're tired. And that has an effect on our mental health. The other part is, and this is the part being on this side of my university education as opposed to when I was in your shoes. And you should also remember every professor and lecturer you have here has been where you're at right now. So they understand whether they want to remember it or not. It's a different story, but they've all been there. Anyways, the issue is on your cognitive functioning in terms of a lack of sleep. And the amount of times that you push yourself just to keep studying more, you've got to do more reviewing, you've got to do more memorization, you've got to read over these notes one more time, you've got to take one more practice test or anything like that. If it's cutting into your sleep, you have to be honest with yourself and recognize that your poor sleep actually has an effect on your cognitive functioning during the test. You're in scanning questions, you'll be less likely to see important keywords like not, for example, you'll miss things, you'll miss words in questions that are key. You will be, your brain will be poor in terms of being able to remember things. Memory function is certainly affected, that free recall. A variety of ways in which people, psychologists have tested for that over the years and it comes up routinely. It's a standard thing you expect. With poor sleep, there's poor free recall. And something as simple as name as many animals as you can in a minute. If you've got a more, you'll do worse on that if you don't have as much sleep. Because your brain just simply loses its capacity to form the connections rapidly to make those, to sort of jump around on things. That's impacted by not having enough sleep. Or ability to problem solve, to see alternate ways of doing things, to look at strategies for approaching a test. You'll be more likely in a NSA, for example, an NSA question, to forget a whole section because you're just, you get more likely to hyper-focus on one thing and not make connections to other things that need to be included. If you're doing a math problem, you'll be stuck in one sort of understanding way to be able to do it and you won't see alternatives that may be more productive. Your brain just doesn't function as well if it's on less sleep. And yet, as students, we very often will push ourselves to study more and give up on the sleep. But the sleep lack of sleep has an impact on heart functioning. So I guess my question is, if you know that, what is it that still has this cultural idea that sleep is not that important and you can give that up and just take a coffee or something, or a big coke and just pump yourself up before you go in. I mean, there's only some, Red Bull will only do so much to assist your cognitive functioning. It won't make up for a lack of sleep. It'll make you more alert and aware of your environment, but your cognitive functioning in terms of sort of making thoughtful connections or a free recall, etc. are still going to be affected. So you can't sort of lose sleep and down two or three Red Bulls before a test. It just doesn't play out. And if that's the case, why do we still do it? Why do students still pull on all nighter? You get something done when you, you know, all literature, all the research would say the quality of the work is just going to be much poorer because you're just not, don't have enough sleep. And the quality of the work the next day after pulling an all nighter will be worse. You're more likely to do stupid things. You're more likely to have car accidents. You're more likely to just, you know, for, you know, just do things you wouldn't normally do because your brain's just not functioning properly. Yet we don't recognize the value that sleep has in terms of us working to our full potential. What is it do you think that's causing us to think that is as of a little importance as we often tend to provide, we often tend to give it? So that's the first question. Second, and third ones relate to eating disorders in that chapter. And eating disorders are certainly during my tenure as a psychologist to become increasingly important to. They really, it was the 1980s where they really sort of jumped up as disorders that need to be treated. And we developed a variety of strong and appropriate treatments for these disorders. We have a greater recognition. We've put more work into sort of primary prevention within schools, for example, to teach, you know, a responsible eating and what the warning signs are and so on. So with all that information though, there are a lot of people who still say it's my choice. It's a choice people make. People with and eating disorders will make the point. I understand everything you're saying, but I don't agree. And this is my choice for my lifestyle. They will make that point. And yet the research says it's not a lifestyle choice. It's an illness. That sense that it's lifestyle choice, particularly for people who have the disorder who are stuck in it for an anorexia in particular. That's an illusion. So I want to hear your thoughts on that. I mean, how much have you thought about it being a lifestyle choice versus, and if somebody says it's my lifestyle choice, leave me alone, should we be intervening? Now, the other issue is, well, the second topic. It's really too combined is around the fact that we have put the DSM-5 and that came out. We suddenly had a brand new psychiatric illness. We didn't have this illness before. Now we've got a brand new psychiatric illness. And it's sort of the flip side of anorexia. It's the idea that, you know, I control my eating so much, I have an illness because I am so much in control. And it's hard to imagine because somebody is saying, you have so much self-control, you know, have an illness, but that's in part the way you sometimes have to think around anorexia. But the idea there is lack of control of eating or binge eating disorder. That was not an illness a few years ago, and now it is. And it's the idea that one day you have an illness. You haven't changed. The system has changed and now we have decided that the way you behave, how you act, how you eat is now an illness where a few days ago it wasn't. And that's what happened when the DSM-5 came out. What are your thoughts on that in terms of how we are sort of categorizing illnesses as a root? You know, eating disorders is one example of it because we're talking about behaviors as illnesses. And saying that this behavior, which before, may have been a problem, is now an illness. I'd like to hear your thoughts on that sort of shift over in terms of our understanding of bad behavior versus illness. A common theme, you'll see in this course. The third topic for later in the week goes back to this issue of, um, how do we differentiate different disorders? I think I make the point in there that one of the weaknesses I sometimes see in the course material is that we don't have a, um, a sense of, you know, how do you differentiate between disorders? There's a bit of that in the textbook, but that really takes up a lot more of a clinician's life is how do you differentiate this illness from this illness because treatments often respond to that different treatments for different illnesses. And this in one particular I'm looking at is the idea of a, either a binge eating disorder or, um, bulimia nervoso, whereas that lack of control of eating. And it's you have the urge to eat and that urge gets greater and greater, greater and greater until finally you give in and the urge goes away. Now with bulimia, you also then have the urge to purge, to purge, to purge, to purge purge and until you purge, it just keeps getting worse and then if you purge it goes away. Doesn't that sound similar to obsessive compulsive disorder? Is this really a form of obsessive compulsive disorder or is it a different illness? And if it is a form of obsessive compulsive disorder, what do you think of the idea that we have certain illnesses which tend to be almost subtypes or particular forms of obsessive compulsive disorder? Obsessive compulsive eating, binge eating, uh, is a binge eating disorder. Obsessive compulsive hair pulling is, dracatical amineia, right? Obsessive compulsive skin peaking is excoration. We have particular illnesses that are based on a particular aspect of obsessive compulsive disorder. So I'd love to hear your thoughts on that. What do you think of? I mean, is this really a form of obsessive compulsive disorder or is it really a separable disorder that needs to be treated in a different way? So that's the three topics for this week. The first one is, if we know so much about sleep, why are, why do you end it? So impact on your mental functioning, your mental health, and your mental functioning, why do we sort of, as a society, say it's not that important? The second one with eating, there are a couple of, the second one has really a couple of topics attached to it about the idea of, you know, should we allow people to say that to have an anorexia as a lifestyle choice or to, or do we just ignore that and just say that you're wrong, you don't have a lifestyle choice, it's an illness. And then with the idea of binge eating and the fact that, you know, lack of control of your eating went from a bad behavior to a diagnosis overnight when the DSM-5 was published and your thoughts on that. And the third one is really about that relationship between obsessive compulsive disorder and some of these other illnesses such as, as we're talking about here, binge eating disorder or bel- or bel- bel- me- anoreso. The idea that you have the urge to eat or the urge to purge and it goes away when you have an engage in the behavior and you may feel lousy afterwards, but at the time it controls you. So those are the three topics for this week. Hope you're doing well and hope you're enjoying the course. Bye-bye.
