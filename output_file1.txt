 Hi everybody, welcome back to philosophy 2073 death. Um, I said it in such an excited way. Uh, this is the first video lecture that I'll be producing for week five. I'm going to produce two, one for each of the two separate readings that are epicurus. Three pages long, once four pages long, so I don't expect these video lectures to be terribly lengthy. Um, the first thing that I want to, uh, do however is a very quick review and then to talk about what it means that there's been a shift in the course. Um, this is the first video lecture for unit two. Uh, why is death bad? Or is it just called is death bad is death bad? Um, I'm going to talk about that in a second. Let me first do my brief review. What have we been talking about to this point in the course definitions of death? So remember, philosophy is about making arguments, presenting the best available reasons, because we're finite and fallible, assembling them to ensure that your beliefs are justified and then presenting them publicly. So as to mitigate your finitude and fallibility, that is your individual uselessness. And in order to be able to have a, uh, meaningful exchange to in order to be able to, um, ensure that our beliefs are, are indeed justified, we're going to need to present some, we're going to need to ensure that what it is we're discussing is clearly defined. And so over the course of weeks one through four, we've been engaging with arguments that seek to explain how we do or ought to understand death, either as a state of being or not, or as a moment in time that can be pinpointed, or as, as we saw in Selbin last week, a, um, a, a, a, a concept that can be unpacked owing to its prevalence and regular use in human communication. No small irony that Feldman's conclusion was ultimately we can't completely unpack that notion in other words, as a concept, death is more mysterious than you would expect it to be given the, um, given its prevalence and its frequent use within human communication. But for our purposes, we're moving on. So that what does that mean? Technically, I mean, we could get stuck in talking about what is death for the duration of the course, but we're moving on to something new. Um, and the something new actually starts with something old. So first thing we're going to talk about is Epicurus first reading we're talking about, uh, notice the dates Epicurus 341 to 270 BCE. So Epicurus was born like six years after Plato died and, uh, Aristotle was 40 to lived another 20 years when Epicurus, uh, after Epicurus was born died when Epicurus was about 20. He's a contemporary of Plato and Aristotle then in that sense. Um, he is not as widely read and so that's why I don't have like I did with Plato, a special video dedicated just to introducing Epicurus. Um, he is not as significant a figure as Plato and Aristotle, but that's kind of through no fault of his own we lost his work. So we have five fragments, three letters and two sets of fragments of what are maybe students notes of what Epicurus wrote. Uh, we actually know him his view, uh, best through subsequent scholars, uh, Roman scholars, particularly a guy named Dioge and he's lairate and, um, and he's a little bit more, um, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more
